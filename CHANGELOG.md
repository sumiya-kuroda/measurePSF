# MPQC Change-Log


### 2026/07/27
 * First write of the YAML file has the curly bracket format throughout, including for empty fields. 
   This makes hand editing easier. 

### 2026/07/23
 * BUGFIX: Grid image was incorrectly rotated. 
 * DEV: `mpqc.interfaces.UniformSlideLive` creates a live preview version of the 
    uniform slide. This maybe will need to be moved to a better location. But it works
    for now, and it does help with alignment. 


### 2026/07/22
 * Disable blanking during uniform slid recording. These bright slides can induce enormous amp ringing that 
  create artifacts that look problematic at brighter signal levels, but are electrical rather than optical.

### 2026/06/23
 * Prompts to edit default fields in YAML. More graceful failure if YAML is broken.
 * Bugfix so microscope name returned without funny characters.

### 2026/03/10
* `measurePSF` reports to user if the Curve Fitting or Image Processing toolbox is not installed. 

### 2026/02/11
* Power meter zeroing function added. ThorlabsPowerMeter updated and tested on PM100D. Isabell Whiteley [PR #114](https://github.com/SWC-Advanced-Microscopy/multiphoton-qc/pull/114).

### 2025/12/04
* Allow serial number of equipment to be numeric only. 
* Merge dev into master

### 2025/12/01
* Major improvements to power measurement to allow users to specify which beams to calibrate, if there are multiple beams configured. Sumiya Kuroda [Issues #108](https://github.com/SWC-Advanced-Microscopy/multiphoton-qc/issues/108).

### 2025/06/18
* UPDATE: Convert power measurement code to a class and add features to enable automation 
     of power measurements. Streamline how the interface to the power meter is handled. RAAC

### 2025/03/07
* NEW: Add facility for checking calibrated power at the sample plane automatically. Isabell Whiteley [PR #95]([https://github.com/SWC-Advanced-Microscopy/multiphoton-qc/pull/95).

### 2025/02/27
* Run lens paper and standard source without ScanImage offset subtraction. 

### 2025/02/24
* NEW: filter uniform slide more aggressively, which is needed for cases with uniform images
* BUGFIX: correctly display photon counts in lens paper data where multiple channels were acquired at once.
* BUGFIX: if weighted fit fails do a Huber fit.
* BUGFIX: correctly loads ScanImage TIFFs from systems with 2 beams
* BUGFIX: deal nicely with low photon counts.
* Minor improvements to lens paper recorder.

### 2025/02/17
Merge of a bunch of recent changes by Rob Campbell
* BREAKING CHANGE! Renamed repo to multiphoton-qc, mpsf -> mpqc. Your settings file will
  now need to be renamed `MPQC_SystemSettings.yml`.
* General doc text tidying. 
* Add `CONTRIBUTION_GUIDELINES.md`
* Made a standalone `CHANGELOG.md` and tidied it and improve formatting.
* Lens paper function now saves all channels.
* Standard source and lens paper produce more similar data (same pixel size)
* Dark noise is longer recorded along with electrical noise.
* Electrical noise function now saves all available channels automatically. 
* Added simple code in `tools` for converting the standard source to photons. 

### 2024/07/19
* NEW FEATURE: `mpsf.record` functions now all accept parameter/value pairs via standard interface.
Inputs that are required not supplied when the function is called are requested interactively at the CLI. Isabell Whiteley [PR #70](https://github.com/SWC-Advanced-Microscopy/measurePSF/pull/70).

### 2024/07/05
* Updates to standard light source. Plotting of said. Bugfixes.
